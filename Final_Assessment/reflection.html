        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>Long ago, Computers and PCs were only devices for people to surf the Internet. Nowadays, people are increasingly 
            using mobile and smartphones of varying screen sizes that run on different OS, like android, windows and ios. 
            However, the appearance of tablets and smartphones has also brought challenges for businesses to develop web apps 
            that are fit for multiple devices. <br>
            <br>
            Responsive web design describes a web design approach that allows websites and pages to render (or display) on 
            all devices and screen sizes by automatically adapting to the screen, whether itâ€™s a desktop, laptop, tablet, 
            or smartphone<a href="https://www.webfx.com/blog/web-design/what-is-responsive-web-design/">(FX,2020)</a>. In other words, responsive design let us have one site, but with different elements 
            that respond correctly on devices of various sizes. When we see a website that does not have a responsive design and 
            view it on a different screen, for instance, on a desktop computer, the site might show many columns. But when you consider 
            that same website on a smaller screen, it might force you to scroll horizontally, or elements might look distorted.
            The impact is also complicated because many tablets can be viewed either in portrait orientation or turned sideways for
            landscape view. Also, on smartphones screens, websites can be even more challenging to see. Large images may break the layout.
            Sites can be slow to load on smartphones if they are graphics-heavy<a href="https://cio-wiki.org/wiki/Responsive_Web_Design_(RWD)">(RWD, 2020)</a>. In conclusion, with responsive design, the website automatically adjusts based on the user's device.<br>
            <br>
            These days, a conversion-focused stunning design of a static website can be developed from scratch using HTML and CSS. 
            To add dynamic features to it, JavaScript will do. Hence, front end technologies such as JavaScript, React JS, Angular JS or Vue 
            JS are commonly used techniques to create responsive websites. As long as you can determine the platform on which the application/website runs, 
            you can use any technology to make it responsive. CSS and HTML are more convenient and more comfortable to create responsive layouts. Whereas JScript is more functional.
            We can use Html for structure, CSS for styling and media queries, JQuery (or possibly Javascript) for extra class addition and that kind of thing.<br>

            I enjoyed my experience with this course. I feel that the course took must of my attention to Web designing and development. 
            I love the design and creating, and this course was one of the best courses I ever had and enjoyed. Lectures and videos were
             structured and easy to learn. I have gained a solid knowledge of web development. The JavaScript topics were a little bit hard 
             at the beginning, but after all the tests and assignments I have done, now I feel more confident in this subject. 
             It is the same as coding in C and C++, and my previous knowledge made this course more comfortable to learn. 
             I think that with my basic knowledge in html5, JS, CSS and also DOM, I could be able to use my creativity to code more basic
              websites.<br>
